//! Diegetic lighting — fluorescent fixtures that actually light the Backrooms, the queryable
//! [`LightField`] gameplay grid (Phase 1), and the light-response markers `Photophobic` /
//! `Phototropic` / `Photophilic` (Phase 2+) that let creatures develop emergent behaviour around
//! light and its absence.
//!
//! Design + literature review: `slop/research/2026-07-11-backrooms-lighting-review-and-design.md`.
//! Bevy's raster renderer does **not** let an emissive `StandardMaterial` illuminate other surfaces
//! (there is no baked GI here), so each fixture lights the scene with a real clustered [`PointLight`];
//! GTAO (Bevy's SSAO *is* GTAO — Jimenez et al., "Practical Real-Time Strategies for Accurate Indirect
//! Occlusion", SIGGRAPH 2016) plus 0.19 contact shadows carve depth into the otherwise flat wash.
//!
//! **Split by concern so the deterministic core stays clean:**
//! - Environment fill (ambient + directional key) lives in [`crate::world`] — pure light *data*, safe
//!   in the headless harness, and config-driven from the same `lighting:` slice.
//! - Fixtures + camera screen-space FX (real lights, GTAO, contact shadows) are cosmetic/GPU and live in
//!   [`LightingPlugin`], registered **only** in the windowed game (never `sim_harness`), so the
//!   exact-hash core never depends on a GPU.
//! - [`LightField`] (Phase 1) is CPU gameplay state read by creature AI, so it *is* harness-visible.
