//! **The crate boundary, enforced.**
//!
//! `bevy_light_grid` is a grid and two passes over it. It takes `bevy_math` for its vector types and
//! `bevy_ecs` for three marker components, and nothing else — no app, no renderer, and above all no game.
//!
//! `bevy_render`/`bevy_pbr` are forbidden for a reason worth stating: this crate is NOT a renderer, and
//! the day it reaches for one is the day somebody has confused "how bright is this cell for the AI" with
//! "what colour is this pixel". Those are different questions with different answers.
//!
//! `bevy_app` is forbidden too, because a field is only reusable if the CALLER owns the schedule — when
//! the bake runs and where it sits relative to the agents reading it are gameplay decisions.
//!
//! These two tests are the ratchet: cheap, and they fail at the door rather than at link time.
//! Widening the list is a design decision, so it should cost a deliberate edit here.
