//! **The cross-section strip**: one procedural texture per region, depth along `x`, tiling along `y`.
//!
//! A cut through flesh is read by its bands and by the grain inside each band, and both are
//! anatomy rather than art: adipose tissue is lobules a millimetre or two across held in a fibrous
//! septal net; skeletal muscle in cross-section is fascicles — bundles of fibres — wrapped in a pale
//! perimysium; cortical bone is dense ivory pierced by Haversian canals a tenth of a millimetre wide;
//! and the marrow cavity opens through a lattice of trabecular struts. Every feature here is drawn
//! at its physical size, because the strip is parameterised in millimetres by [`Layers`] and the
//! caller's [`crate::Scale`], so a 2 mm lobule is 2 mm on a thigh and 2 mm on a finger.
//!
//! The muscle band's colour is not authored: it is a thin venous film from `bloodstain::spectral`
//! over a mid-grey substrate — the same optics that colour a pool, because a freshly cut muscle
//! surface is wet with exactly that. Fat, skin, cortex and marrow carry authored albedos; those are
//! stated as this crate's own.
//!
//! Everything is a hash of integer texel coordinates through `bloodstain::hash_f32`, so a strip is
//! a pure function of its inputs and two machines bake the same bytes.
