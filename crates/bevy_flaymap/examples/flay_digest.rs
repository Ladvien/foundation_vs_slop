//! **The crate's headline claim, run as a program.** No window, no GPU, no `App`.
//!
//! A damage mask that lives on the GPU cannot be hashed — that is why every other texture-space
//! destruction system is a picture rather than a state. This one takes thirty hits at one spot on a
//! limb, prints how many texels of each tissue are showing after every one, names the hit on which
//! bone came through, and prints the digest. Run it twice: the number is the same.
//!
//! Run it over ssh if you like. That is rather the point.
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p bevy_flaymap --example flay_digest
//! ```
