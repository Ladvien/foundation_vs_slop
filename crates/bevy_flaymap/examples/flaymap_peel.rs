//! **A wound you can hash**, with a renderer attached.
//!
//! A lit slab is hit every twenty frames at the same spot while the camera orbits it. The crater opens
//! through skin, then fat, then muscle, and stops when it reaches bone — and the rim is the whole
//! point: because a hit falls off smoothly to nothing at its radius, every layer it has passed through
//! is on show at once, at the depths those tissues were measured at. The number on screen is the
//! canvas's own digest, taken over the CPU depth buffer.
//!
//! Nothing here reads a clock or the filesystem: the cadence, the orbit and the digest all come off a
//! `Local<u32>` frame counter, so this example builds for `wasm32-unknown-unknown` as-is.
//!
