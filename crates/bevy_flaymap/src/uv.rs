//! **World-space hit → texture-space UV.** Möller–Trumbore, then a barycentric UV read.

//! Möller & Trumbore, *"Fast, minimum storage ray-triangle intersection"*, Journal of Graphics Tools
//! 2(1), 1997, `doi:10.1080/10867651.1997.10487468`. Reimplemented here rather than imported: it is
//! thirty lines, and the two crates that already own a copy are both on the wrong side of this one.
//! `bevy_carnage` composes this crate, so depending on it would invert the layering; `bevy_wetmap` is
//! a **sibling**, not a base, and taking a dependency on it would mean an actor that only ever gets
//! flayed still resolves a blood-drip model it never calls.
//!
//! # Why a miss and an unusable mesh are different answers
//!
//! A ray that misses is ordinary — a shot went past the actor — so it is silent. A mesh with no
//! `ATTRIBUTE_UV_0` is a **content bug**: it cannot carry a flaymap at all, and every hit a caller
//! thinks it is peeling will never appear anywhere. Silently peeling nothing there is the failure
//! this module returns a distinct variant for, so the canvas can say so once and then shut up.
