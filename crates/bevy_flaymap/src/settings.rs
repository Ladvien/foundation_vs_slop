//! **Every dial a flaymap has, in one struct, with the arithmetic behind each value.**
//!
//! # No clock, no rate
//!
//! Nothing here is per second and nothing here is per tick. A flaymap does not evolve on its own —
//! tissue that has been peeled off stays off — so the only schedule in the crate is the upload
//! budget, and the only time-shaped number is how many canvases may reach the GPU in one frame.
//! That is why this struct has four fields where `bevy_wetmap::WetSettings` has eight.
//!
//! # The two that decide what the wound looks like
//!
//! [`FlaySettings::tile_mm`] and [`FlaySettings::seed`] are handed straight to
//! `bevy_cross_section::texel_at`, so a flayed patch and a cut face on the same body are shaded by
//! **one** tissue model at **one** physical scale rather than by two that drift.
