//! **The geometry kernel: a cut along a surface, opened.**
//!
//! One function, [`tear`], and it is a pure function of its arguments — no clock, no RNG crate, no
//! global. That is what lets [`digest`] freeze its output in a test.
//!
//! # The model, and whose it is
//!
//! Kamarianakis, Protopsaltis, Angelis, Tamiolakis & Papagiannakis, *"Progressive tearing and
//! cutting of soft-bodies in high-performance virtual reality"*, ICAT-EGVE 2022,
//! `doi:10.48550/arXiv.2209.08531`, describes a tear as three things, and this module is those three
//! things:
//!
//! 1. **A user-defined width along a sampled path** (§3.1). The path is a polyline the caller hands
//!    in; the width is [`TearShape::half_width`] either side of it. Not a physical crack criterion —
//!    the paper's tear is authored, and so is this one, which is why a gape can be driven from a
//!    time curve instead of a stress solve.
//! 2. **Faces inside the gap are clipped** (§3.1). Here: a triangle whose three vertices all lie
//!    within `half_width` of the polyline is removed outright. The paper subdivides the partially
//!    covered faces; this crate snaps their inside vertices to the rail instead, which keeps the
//!    vertex buffer index-stable and therefore keeps skinning weights valid — see below.
//! 3. **Auxiliary particles displaced normal to and away from the tear segments** (§3.3.4), which is
//!    what actually *opens* the wound rather than merely punching a hole in it. Here: every vertex
//!    within [`TearShape::influence`] of the polyline moves along `±side` — the in-surface
//!    perpendicular `normal × segment_direction` — by `half_width · (1 - d/influence)²`, so the
//!    displacement falls to zero with a zero derivative at the edge of the influence radius and the
//!    surface does not crease there.
//!
//! The lips do not spring back: a laceration is the ductile case of O'Brien, Bargteil & Hodgins,
//! *"Graphical modeling and animation of ductile fracture"*, SIGGRAPH 2002,
//! `doi:10.1145/566570.566579`, where plastic deformation is retained ahead of separation. The
//! caller drives `half_width` monotonically (see [`crate::gape`]) and this module never closes
//! anything.
//!
//! # Why the vertex buffer keeps its length
//!
//! **A vertex is never added to or removed from the skin mesh — only moved.** A skinned character's
//! `ATTRIBUTE_JOINT_INDEX` and `ATTRIBUTE_JOINT_WEIGHT` are per-vertex, and so is every other
//! attribute a consumer might have authored; carrying them through a re-indexing is a copy per
//! attribute per retear, and getting it wrong is a limb that follows the wrong bone. Keeping the
//! buffer identical and rewriting only positions and indices makes that class of bug unreachable.
//! The cost is that vertices inside the gap can end up referenced by nothing, which wastes a few
//! bytes of vertex buffer and nothing else.
//!
//! # Where the numbers come from
//!
//! [`RAIL_WANDER`] and [`WANDER_MM`] are **this crate's own** — no paper in the corpus tabulates the
//! raggedness of a wound margin. Everything else geometric is the caller's authoring.
