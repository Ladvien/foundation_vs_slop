//! **An impact, projected onto the modes, and the partition it leaves.**
//!
//! Sellán et al. (`doi:10.1145/3549540`, §3.4): at runtime an impact at point `p` with direction
//! `n⃗` is blurred one implicit step along the shape, `g = (M + τL)⁻¹ M δ_p`, projected onto the
//! precomputed modes, `w* = Σ_i U_i A_i δ_p n⃗`, and the exploded mesh is **glued back together**
//! wherever two coincident vertices' deformations agree: `‖w*_af − w*_cg‖ < σ`. What is left apart
//! is the fracture pattern. Because the projection is linear, *"scaling σ and scaling the magnitude
//! of the impact are equivalent"*, so `σ` is fixed at their `10⁻³` and the impulse carries the size
//! of the blow.
//!
//! On the cell graph the modes are scalar (see [`crate::modes`]), the direction factors out of the
//! norm, and the gluing rule on a shared face reads `|s_a − s_b| · |impulse| < σ` with
//! `s = Σ_i φ_i · A_i[p]`. Cells joined by an unbroken face are one fragment.
