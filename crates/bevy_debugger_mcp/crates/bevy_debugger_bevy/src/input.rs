//! Headless input injection — drives keyboard and mouse without the OS.
//!
//! Writes into **the same message stream `bevy_winit` writes to**, inside the game process. Nothing
//! here reaches the operating system: if the person at the machine is working in another window,
//! injected keys do not go there. That is structural rather than careful — this crate depends on
//! `bevy`, `bevy_remote`, `serde`, `serde_json` and `image`, none of which can synthesise an OS event.
//!
//! # Injected input *is* input, rather than a copy of its effects
//!
//! A real key produces exactly one thing: a [`KeyboardInput`] message. `ButtonInput<KeyCode>` and
//! `ButtonInput<Key>` are Bevy's own **fold** of that stream, done by `keyboard_input_system` in
//! [`InputSystems`](bevy::input::InputSystems).
//!
//! This module used to write the fold and not the source, and that is exactly one half of a key.
//! Everything reading `ButtonInput` saw injected keys; everything reading the stream — **every text
//! field in every Bevy application** — could not, so no agent could type, and could not press Enter or
//! Escape in a field either, because those are read off `logical_key` too. Writing the source instead
//! makes both halves land from one request, which is what "indistinguishable from a real key" has to
//! mean.
//!
//! # Key names come from Bevy, not from a table here
//!
//! `key` and `button` are deserialized straight into [`KeyCode`] and [`MouseButton`], so every key
//! Bevy knows is accepted and the spelling is Bevy's own variant name — `KeyW`, `ArrowLeft`, `F11`,
//! `Numpad7`, `ShiftLeft`, `BracketRight`, `AudioVolumeUp`.
//!
//! This replaced a hand-written `match` covering twelve keys. Such a table is a second, always-stale
//! copy of an enum with nearly two hundred variants: it silently lacked every function key, every
//! modifier, every digit and the whole numpad, and nothing would have told you except an
//! `Unknown key` at the moment you needed one. Deserializing has no drift by construction — a Bevy
//! upgrade that adds a key adds it here.
//!
//! **The logical half comes from the same string through the same mechanism.** `KeyCode` has 194 unit
//! variants and [`Key`] has 306, and **93 are spelled identically** — `Enter`, `Escape`, `Backspace`,
//! `Space`, `Tab`, `Delete`, every arrow, every `F1`–`F35`. For those, [`logical_for`] hands the
//! caller's own name to Bevy's `Key` deserializer and no table exists to go stale. For the rest —
//! `KeyW`, `Numpad7`, `ShiftLeft` — the answer is `Key::Unidentified`, because `KeyW` is `w` on QWERTY
//! and `,` on Dvorak, and guessing which is precisely the table that was deleted above.
//!
//! `MouseButton::Other(u16)` is reachable as `{"Other": 3}`, since that is how serde spells a
//! newtype variant.
