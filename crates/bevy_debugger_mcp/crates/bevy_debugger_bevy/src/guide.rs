//! **The step you are on, shown where the work is** — the agent-to-human half of the channel.
//!
//! An agent driving a Bevy app can already post input and read frames back. What it cannot do is
//! *tell the person at the keyboard what to try*, so every instruction goes to a terminal they have
//! to look away from their work to read, and every answer comes back as prose the agent then has to
//! guess its way from. This posts a script the app renders one step at a time, watches a stated
//! condition, and records what actually happened.
//!
//! # A step is a guided-exploration card, and that shape is forty years old
//!
//! Carroll's minimalist instruction (`10.14434/ijdl.v5i2.12887`) put adults in front of unfamiliar
//! software with 25 cards in place of ~100 manual pages, and measured them making *"more progress in
//! less time"*, recognising errors better and recovering *"more often and more rapidly"*. A card
//! carries brief hints, **a checkpoint**, and **error recognition and recovery information** — and
//! that third field is the one Chauvergne et al. 2023 (`10.1145/3544548.3581211`) could not find in a
//! single one of twenty-one shipped tutorials they reviewed: *"we did not find any tutorial that
//! gives detailed instructions"* on correcting a wrong action.
//!
//! So [`Step`] is that card, field for field, and the checkpoint is what this module watches.
//!
//! # One step, pushed, never a script to read first
//!
//! Andersen et al. 2012 (`10.1145/2207676.2207687`, N = 45,318) crossed four tutorial variables
//! across three games. In the complex, unconventional interface — the condition an editor is in —
//! giving instructions *"as closely as possible to when they were needed, rather than out of context
//! in an up-front manual, increased play time by 16% and progress by 40%."*
//!
//! Two of their negative results shape this as much as that one:
//!
//! - **Restricting freedom to make the user perform the step had no effect in any of the three
//!   games.** So this never gates input, and the app stays fully usable with a step on screen.
//! - **An on-demand help button cost 12% of levels completed and 15% of play time**, and only 31% of
//!   players ever clicked it. So there is no help affordance here to go and ask: the current step is
//!   pushed, and a caller that wants it gone hides it.
//!
//! # What comes back is `k/n`, never a boolean
//!
//! Bryant, *Game Testing All in One* 4e, on reproduction rate: a tester who ran the steps twice and
//! saw the bug twice could *"reasonably"* report 100%, and it is *"just as likely that the bug is
//! only reproducible 50% of the time or less, and you just got lucky, as though you had flipped a
//! penny and got it to land heads-up twice in a row. For this reason, many QA labs report the
//! reproduction rate as the number of observed occurrences over the number of attempts."*
//!
//! [`StepRecord`] counts runs and passes across every run of a script, which is the single thing a
//! machine watching the checkpoint buys that asking the person does not.
