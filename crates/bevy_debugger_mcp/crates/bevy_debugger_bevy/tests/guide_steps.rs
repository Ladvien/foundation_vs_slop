//! **The guide channel's contract, pinned.**
//!
//! The half of this crate that talks to a *person* has a failure mode the other two do not: it can be
//! wrong in a way that still returns `success: true` and still renders. So what is checked here is
//! mostly the behaviour over *time* — what the watch stream sends on the second frame, and the
//! third — because that is where a condition-watcher goes wrong.
//!
//! Four properties:
//!
//! 1. **A checkpoint decides, and the host owns it.** A registered condition that answers false parks
//!    the request; one that answers true advances the step and records the pass. A name nobody
//!    registered is refused *by name*, listing what would have worked.
//! 2. **Every non-advancing answer is sent once.** The handler re-runs every frame, so "this step has
//!    no checkpoint" and "the script is done" would otherwise be pushed sixty times a second down a
//!    stream whose entire contract is *something happened*.
//! 3. **The transcript is `k/n`, and it survives a re-post.** Bryant, *Game Testing All in One* 4e:
//!    a boolean pass is the thing a person reports and gets wrong. Counts that reset on every run
//!    would be the same boolean wearing a fraction's clothes.
//! 4. **The overlay shows one step, and only while there is one.** Never the script (Andersen et al.
//!    2012: instructions given in context beat an up-front manual by 40% progress), and nothing at all
//!    when idle.
//!
//! Every test here was verified by putting the bug back — the discipline the tiles contract records.
//! Three of them exist *because* the bug was there. Two `announced_once` tests: the first draft of
//! `watch_guide` answered both non-advancing cases unconditionally, at sixty frames a second.
//!
//! And `a_skipped_step_is_not_confirmed_as_a_pass`, which is the one worth reading twice — **a full
//! green suite is not evidence the overlay is right.** Every test here passed while the card
//! congratulated a person for reporting that a step made no sense, because both outcomes rendered
//! text and nothing asserted which. A devshot capture of the real editor is what noticed. When the
//! output is something a human reads, at some point somebody has to look at it.
