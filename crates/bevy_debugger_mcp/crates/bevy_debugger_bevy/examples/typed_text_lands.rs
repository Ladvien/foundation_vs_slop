//! **An agent can type — shown in a terminal, no GPU.**
//!
//! For as long as this crate existed it could press keys and not type into them, and the difference
//! was invisible from the outside because `bevy_debugger/input` answered `success: true` either way.
//!
//! The cause was that it wrote `ButtonInput` — Bevy's *fold* of the input stream — rather than the
//! stream. Everything reading `ButtonInput` saw injected keys; **every text field in every Bevy
//! application** reads `MessageReader<KeyboardInput>` and matches on `logical_key`, and saw nothing.
//! Not just letters: `Enter` and `Escape` are read off `logical_key` too, so a field could not even be
//! committed or cancelled. Three separate verifications were blocked by this in one day.
//!
//! The system below is the shape a real text field has — the same shape ten handlers in
//! `emerge-mapper` have. It is driven here with no MCP server, no network and no window.
//!
//! Run it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p bevy_debugger_bevy --example typed_text_lands
//! ```
//!
//! Four things to look for, and the last two are the ones that cost something to learn:
//!
//! 1. **A whole word arrives in one frame.** A stream is not a state, so there is no edge to lose and
//!    nothing to spread out — naming a composition is one call, not one call per letter.
//! 2. **`Enter` in the same batch commits it**, because nothing defers behind text.
//! 3. **A space arrives as `Key::Space`, not `Key::Character(" ")`** — the one character with a named
//!    variant, and the one a text field would otherwise drop while the call reported success.
//! 4. **Text queued alongside the key that *opens* a field waits a frame.** Fields drain the stream
//!    while shut so the opening keystroke cannot become their first character; sent together, the
//!    text would be eaten by that guard and the method would still report success.
