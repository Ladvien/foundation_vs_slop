//! **An agent can tell a person what to try — shown in a terminal, no GPU.**
//!
//! This crate could already put input *into* an app and get frames *out* of it. What it could not do
//! was say a sentence to the person at the keyboard, so every instruction went to a terminal they had
//! to look away from their work to read, and every answer came back as prose the agent then had to
//! guess its way from.
//!
//! `bevy_debugger/guide` posts a script; the app renders one step; `bevy_debugger/guide+watch` waits
//! on a condition the *host* named, advances itself, and records what actually happened.
//!
//! Run it:
//!
//! ```sh
//! cargo run -p bevy_debugger_bevy --example guided_steps_land
//! ```
//!
//! There is no window, no socket and no person: the two handlers are ordinary Bevy systems, and a
//! stand-in "author" below satisfies each condition a few frames after it is asked for. What the run
//! prints is the transcript an agent would receive.
//!
//! Four things to look for:
//!
//! 1. **The overlay shows one step**, never the script. Andersen et al. 2012 (CHI, N = 45,318) found
//!    instructions delivered in context beat an up-front manual by 40% progress in the complex,
//!    unconventional interface -- which is what an editor is.
//! 2. **A step is Carroll's guided-exploration card**: a label, why it is being asked, two to four
//!    hints, a checkpoint, and what to do when it does not happen. Chauvergne et al. 2023 could not
//!    find that last field in a single one of twenty-one shipped tutorials.
//! 3. **The watch stream answers only when something happens.** While the condition is unmet the
//!    handler returns `Ok(None)` and the engine parks the request -- the frames printed as `.` below.
//! 4. **The transcript is `k/n`, never a boolean.** Bryant, *Game Testing All in One* 4e: a tester who
//!    ran the steps twice and saw it twice will report 100%, and it is just as likely to be 50%.
