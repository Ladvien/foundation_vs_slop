//! **The fracture, rendered headless, one PNG per frame — and colour-coded by what the audit says.**
//!
//! `explode` is the demo you watch; this is the one you *measure*. It renders the same subject and the
//! same burst, but with no window, no winit and no wall clock: the update loop is pumped by hand and
//! the integrator is driven by a fixed `DT`, so frame 47 of one run is frame 47 of the next. That is
//! what makes the output diffable — a GIF from before a ticket and a GIF from after differ only where
//! the geometry differs.
//!
//! **The skin colour is the finding, not decoration.** Each fragment is audited with
//! [`bevy_carnage::audit_proxy`] and tinted by the verdict:
//!
//! | colour | meaning |
//! |---|---|
//! | green | watertight **and** manifold — a closed solid, the thing we want |
//! | amber | watertight but **not** manifold — closed, yet not a surface a solver can trust |
//! | red | **open cut edges** — a cap that never closed, so this piece is not a solid at all |
//!
//! Cut faces keep the dark interior material regardless, because that contrast is what makes a break
//! read as a break at all. See `explode.rs`.
//!
//! The verdict is taken on the **proxy cell** — the artefact that is a solid — never on the render
//! skin, which is a surface subset and open by construction. Under Tier A every fragment should come
//! back green: a plane through a convex cell yields two convex cells, with no input for which that can
//! fail. Magenta here means the cell clipper is wrong, not that the subject was awkward.
//!
//! Frames land in `--out <dir>` (default `frames/`) as `frame0000.png`. Turn them into a GIF with:
//!
//! ```text
//! ffmpeg -y -framerate 30 -i frames/frame%04d.png \
//!        -vf "scale=640:-1:flags=lanczos,split[a][b];[a]palettegen[p];[b][p]paletteuse" out.gif
//! ```
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example capture -- --out frames`
