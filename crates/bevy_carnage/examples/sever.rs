//! **It comes apart where you hit it.**
//!
//! `explode.rs` shows the other half of this crate: a subject stands there, then it is all of its
//! fragments at once. That is the right shape for a death, and the wrong shape for everything else —
//! it is the same burst however the thing died, which is what makes a demo read as *froze, then
//! shattered*.
//!
//! This example keeps the subject standing and takes pieces off it. One bake, cached once at
//! startup; every blow is a region query against it plus a threshold, and whatever stops being
//! connected falls off. Hit it again and it comes apart further.
//!
//! ```text
//!   arrows / WASD   move the aim marker
//!   1               a projectile   — nearest fragment, then outward along the bonds
//!   2               a slash        — falloff from the segment a blade travelled
//!   3               a swept blade  — every bond the swing passed through, no falloff
//!   4               a blast        — falloff from a point in open space
//!   5               a pull         — weighted by how squarely each face meets it
//!   G               granularity — cycle which frontier of the bake is standing
//!   T               soften — cycle how hard the drawn fragments are rounded (re-bakes)
//!   R               reset
//! ```
//!
//! **Nothing here is in the crate.** `bevy_carnage` hands out a reach — a severity per bond — and
//! `common::body` picks the threshold at which one gives way, decides which island is still "the
//! body", and throws the rest. A game scales that severity by material and by how much damage the
//! blow carried; none of those are facts the crate has.
//!
//! The subject and those rules live in `common::body` because `capture_sever.rs` drives them too —
//! so the GIF in the README is this example on rails, not a re-implementation that could drift.
//!
//! Needs a GPU.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run -p bevy_carnage --example sever`
