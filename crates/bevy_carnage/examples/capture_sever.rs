//! **`sever`, on rails, rendered headless — the GIF the README shows.**
//!
//! `sever` is interactive, which makes it the wrong thing to record: what you would capture depends
//! on what you happened to press. This runs the same subject through a fixed script on a fixed
//! timestep, so frame 62 of one run is frame 62 of the next and two GIFs differ only where the
//! geometry does.
//!
//! **The scene and the rules are `common::body`, not copies of them.** A recorder that
//! reimplements its subject drifts from it silently, and the drift is invisible in exactly the place
//! you would look for it. What lives here is only the script: where each blow lands, which kind it
//! is, and on which frame.
//!
//! The script is chosen to show the one thing `explode` cannot — that the subject *stays standing*
//! between blows, and that what comes off depends on where you hit it:
//!
//! | frame | what |
//! |---|---|
//! | 0 | intact, all 34 pieces standing |
//! | 18 | a projectile to the left shoulder — the arm goes, the body stays up |
//! | 48 | one to the head |
//! | 80 | a slash at the right shoulder |
//! | 112 | a swept blade through the waist, taking the legs |
//! | 144 | a blast in the chest, which finishes what is left |
//!
//! Frames land in `--out <dir>` (default `frames-sever/`). Turn them into a GIF with `tools/gif.sh`.
//!
//! Run: `cargo run --release --example capture_sever -- --out frames-sever`
