        // **The bake runs here, on the main thread, and `AG-011` settled that by measuring rather than
        // arguing.** The torso-and-head fixture at its finest 12 fragments measures **~2.2 ms**
        // (release, `cargo run --release --example fracture_cube`), up from ~1.4 ms before the bake
        // kept its hierarchy — the ratio tracks node count, 23 nodes built instead of 12, which is
        // what keeping every piece the loop split costs. The ticket's own threshold was "a fix is
        // warranted at 50 ms and not at 5 ms", so this stays well the safe side of it.
        //
        // The figure recorded here was **0.33 ms**, and re-measuring found that stale on this
        // machine even before the change: the pre-hierarchy code measures ~1.4 ms today. Both
        // numbers are below the threshold, so the conclusion is unchanged — but the old one was
        // being quoted as if it had been re-checked, and it had not.
        //
        // Recording the alternative so nobody re-derives it: moving this to `AsyncComputeTaskPool`
        // would need `bevy/multi_threaded`, which this crate deliberately does not declare. Without it
        // that pool is single-threaded and `spawn` runs the work inline anyway — so the "async" bake
        // would be async only in builds where some *other* crate happened to turn the feature on, via
        // feature unification. One code path that is concurrent in some consumers' builds and not
        // others is exactly the ambiguity `CLAUDE.md`'s one-path rule exists to prevent, and buying it
        // for 0.33 ms would be a bad trade twice over.
