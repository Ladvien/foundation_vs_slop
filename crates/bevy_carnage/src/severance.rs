//! **Where a blow lands, in geometry.** Region queries that say how strongly something reaches each
//! bond — and nothing about what it was, how hard it hit, or what happens next.
//!
//! # The shape, and why it is two steps
//!
//! Every query returns a [`Reach`]: a severity in `[0, 1]` for each bond the region touched, `1` at
//! full effect and falling to `0` at the edge. Turning that into severed bonds is
//! [`Reach::above`], and the threshold is the caller's number.
//!
//! Splitting it there is deliberate. A game scales severity by what the thing is made of, how much
//! damage the blow carried, or how much the bond has already taken — and all three are facts this
//! crate does not have. Folding a threshold into the query would mean either inventing a damage
//! model here or handing back a decision the caller could not adjust. Reach out, threshold yours.
//!
//! # Why this is a runtime query and not a bake parameter
//!
//! Müller, Chentanez & Kim state the problem exactly: with a static pre-fracture "there is no way to
//! align fracture patterns with the impact location at run time… When a gamer shoots at a glass
//! window, she expects the spider-web-shaped fracture pattern to be centered around the location
//! where the bullet hit the glass. Anything else clearly destroys the illusion." Their answer, and
//! PhysX Blast's after them, is to bake a decomposition once and *select* against it per impact.
//! That is what this module is: the bake stays reproducible and cached, and every blow is a pure
//! function of it plus a region.
//!
//! # The five regions
//!
//! They follow Blast's damage-shader set, because that set was arrived at by shipping games and it
//! covers the cases without overlapping:
//!
//! | query | the thing it models |
//! |---|---|
//! | [`spread`] | a projectile — nearest fragment, then outward *along the bonds*, so a hit takes a connected chunk rather than everything within a sphere |
//! | [`capsule`] | a swung edge — falloff from the segment the blade travelled |
//! | [`swept_triangle`] | a swept blade proper — every bond the swing passed *through* gives way, regardless of distance |
//! | [`radial`] | a blast — falloff from a point in open space |
//! | [`directional`] | a pull — falloff weighted by how squarely each shared face meets the direction of the tear |
//!
//! Nothing here is named for a weapon. `spread` is not "bullet" and `capsule` is not "sword",
//! because the crate that knows which is which is yours.
