//! **Tier A — the proxy.** A convex cell, and the plane cut that divides one into two.
//!
//! This is the half of the fracture that is *provably* correct, and it is the reason the rest of the
//! crate got simpler rather than harder. Production fracture does not cut the render mesh: Müller,
//! Chentanez & Kim (`10.1145/2461912.2461934`, the lineage behind PhysX Blast) cut a volumetric convex
//! decomposition and carry the visual triangles as a payload. The load-bearing consequence is one line
//! of geometry:
//!
//! > **plane ∩ convex polyhedron = convex polygon.**
//!
//! Every cut face this module produces is therefore convex, which means a centroid fan over it is
//! valid — no loop recovery, no ambiguous vertex walk, no star-shapedness to hope for. The whole class
//! of defect that `assemble_loops` existed to survive cannot arise here. It is not that we found a
//! better loop-recovery algorithm; it is that we stopped generating inputs that need one.
//!
//! # Two decisions that look like details and are not
//!
//! **Faces are polygons, never triangles.** This is Müller's Figure 9, stated there as a warning: a
//! hexagon split twice using general polygonal faces stays clean, while the same splits with triangular
//! faces produce *"many ill shaped triangles… even after only two cuts."* A fracture is *repeated*
//! cutting, so that degradation compounds. Triangulation happens once, at emit time, in [`ProxyCell::
//! append_cut_faces`]. It is the same sliver pathology `AG-011` records for `Soup::extent`, and Tier A
//! must not inherit it.
//!
//! **The caller supplies the cells.** This crate does not compute a convex decomposition and will not:
//! a consumer already running V-HACD or CoACD for its colliders has one, and forcing a second,
//! different decomposition on them would be the fracture disagreeing with the physics about what the
//! object is. See the boundary list in `CLAUDE.md`.
//!
//! # Winding, sign and coordinate conventions
//!
//! - A face ring is wound **counter-clockwise seen from outside the cell**, so its Newell normal points
//!   *away* from the interior.
//! - [`ProxyCell::clip`] returns `(above, below)` relative to `plane.normal`. The **above** piece gains
//!   a cut face whose outward normal is `-plane.normal`; the **below** piece's faces `+plane.normal`.
//! - Distances are signed positive on the `+normal` side, matching [`crate::soup`].
