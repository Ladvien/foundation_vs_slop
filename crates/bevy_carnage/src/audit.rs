//! **What the fracture actually produced** — the measurement this crate spent its whole life without.
//!
//! `examples/fracture_cube.rs` has always been honest that its one quality number counts closed *loops*
//! and is "NOT a watertightness proof". This module is the proof, or the refusal of it: it takes a
//! finished [`FragmentGeometry`] and reports whether that shard is closed, manifold, consistently
//! wound, and safe to hand a physics engine as a triangle mesh.
//!
//! # Two things here are load-bearing, and both are easy to get backwards
//!
//! **A fragment is audited as skin ∪ cap, never as two meshes.** The crate hands out the subject's
//! outer surface and the newly-cut faces separately so they can take different materials — but
//! *neither one is a closed surface on its own*, and never can be. The skin is missing exactly the
//! faces the cut created; the cap is a bare disc. Only their union can be watertight, so auditing
//! either alone would produce a large, confident, meaningless boundary-edge count.
//!
//! **The mesh is welded before it is measured.** [`crate::soup::Soup::push_tri`] allocates three fresh
//! vertices for every triangle it emits, and every triangle in a cut piece came from `push_tri` — so a
//! fragment reaches this module with `positions.len() == 3 * triangles` and no two triangles sharing an
//! index. Topology over that buffer is not merely inaccurate, it is *vacuous*: every edge is incident
//! to exactly one face, so everything is a boundary edge and the Euler characteristic is noise.
//! `isomesh` learned this about its own subgrid extractor and now documents "weld before you validate";
//! this module does the weld so no caller has to know that.
//!
//! The weld is position-only, which is right here and wrong everywhere else — see [`WELD_EPSILON`].
