//! Which fragments actually touch — the adjacency a localised break needs.
//!
//! A hierarchy says which fragments *nest*. It does not say which ones are *neighbours*, and those
//! are different questions: two leaves cut from a common ancestor need not share a face. Without
//! neighbours the only expressible outcome is "all of it comes apart at once", which is the whole
//! complaint this phase exists to answer.
//!
//! # The match is exact, and that is deliberate
//!
//! Müller, Chentanez & Kim's §3.3 gives the algorithm, and it is exact for convex cells:
//!
//! > "create a list with entries for all the faces of all the convexes… each entry contains a link
//! > to the convex and the absolute value |d| of the plane equation n·x + d = 0 of the face. After
//! > sorting by the value |d|, entries with identical values (up to a numerical epsilon) can be
//! > identified during a single pass through the list… To compute the amount of overlap s ∈ [0,1] we
//! > project the faces into their common plane and perform a planar convex-convex intersection."
//!
//! Two cells are neighbours iff one has a face that lies in the same plane as a face of the other,
//! wound the opposite way, with positive overlap area. Every cut this crate makes produces exactly
//! that: [`ProxyCell::clip`](crate::proxy::ProxyCell) hands the *same* cut ring to both halves,
//! reversed for one of them, so the two faces are coplanar to the bit and overlap completely.
//!
//! # What this deliberately does not find, and why it is not patched
//!
//! **Cells that touch without sharing a coplanar face get no bond.** That is the normal case
//! *between* the caller's original proxy cells: V-HACD and CoACD produce cells that abut without
//! their boundary polygons agreeing, and two separate shells — a head sunk into a torso — properly
//! interpenetrate rather than meet. So each root's subtree comes out as its own island.
//!
//! Closing that gap would mean a proximity or overlap-volume heuristic, and a heuristic here is
//! exactly the wrong trade: it would silently weld a head to a torso, which is the *correctness*
//! loss `BACKLOG.md` records Sacht et al. measuring, and it would do it with a tolerance nobody
//! could tune from the outside. A caller who wants their root cells bonded should hand in a
//! decomposition whose cells share faces — a grid, or a volumetric decomposition in Müller's sense.
//! Refusing is the one path; approximating would be two.
//!
//! # No damage model lives here
//!
//! A [`Bond`] carries geometry — where the shared face is, which way it faces, and how large it is.
//! It carries no health and no strength, because what an area is *worth* depends on what the thing
//! is made of and what hit it, and this crate knows neither. [`BondSet`] is likewise pure state the
//! caller owns: this module only ever answers "given these bonds are broken, what is still
//! connected".
