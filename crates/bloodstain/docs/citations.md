# Citations, and whether they resolve locally

Every paper this crate's code comments name, with its DOI and whether it is in the local
[home-still](https://github.com/Ladvien) corpus on host `big` (`/mnt/home-still`, catalog + the
`academic_papers` distill collection).

**Why this file exists.** A code comment that names a paper is a promise the reader can check. 21 of
the 31 papers below have **no open-access PDF**, so `hs paper download --doi <DOI>` refuses them — and
that refusal is recorded here rather than retried by hand, so the comment still names something a
reader can resolve through a library or a publisher. First ingestion run 2026-09-02 on `big` while
holding the `papers` GPU claim; the exact failure text was
`Download failed: Not found: No open-access PDF found for DOI: …` in every case. The four papers the
injury kernels added on 2026-09-04 were already in the corpus; the three *values* they needed and
could not find there — the two outer burn `Ω` thresholds, and the bruise's yellow-onset time — are
named as missing in their own rows rather than quietly rounded into a literal.

## Constants that are tuned rather than measured

Named here as well as in their own doc comments, because a tuned constant that says so is honest and
one dressed as a measurement is not.

| Constant | Status |
|---|---|
| `stain::SPINE_WE_MIN = 30.0` | **TUNED.** Adam 2012 documents that a spine onset *exists*; it gives no single threshold that transfers to this model's units, and the paper is not open access, so the value could not be confirmed. |
| `stain::SPLASH_K_CRIT = 57.7` | **Sourced.** Mundo, Sommerfeld & Tropea (1995) deposition/splash boundary in `K = We^0.5 · Re^0.25`, equivalently `Oh · Re^1.25`. |
| `rheo::PERFUSION_STRESS_PA = 10.0` | **TUNED.** A stress scale, not a measurement: chosen so a fresh wound flows against the Casson yield stress and the clot arrest lands inside the bleed taper. |
| `BloodSettings::hct_exponent = 2.5` | **TUNED.** Carreau–Yasuda was fitted at Hct ≈ 45 %; hematocrit-dependent variants exist and are deliberately not adopted. |
| `dry::DRY_REF_TICKS = 1800` | **Compressed, and stated.** Laan et al. measure tens of minutes; the *shape* is theirs, the clock is 30 s at 60 Hz so a game can show it. |
| `bruise::Params::subcutis_mm = 3.0` | **OWN.** Stam's Table 1 gives dermal thicknesses only, and this one sets the pool's volume — the most load-bearing authored number in the module. |
| `bruise::Params::ho_induction_h = 48.0` | **OWN, mechanism sourced.** Stam fit a "relaxation time" that is not legible in this corpus' extraction of their Table 1. Chosen against Langlois & Gresham's "no yellow inside a day", and pinned by `the_red_peaks_before_the_yellow`. |
| `bruise::DERMIS_MUSP_MM = 2.0` | **OWN.** Bosschaart tabulates *blood*; the scattering of the dermis the blood sits in has no source here. A scale, not a spectrum. |
| `bruise::BILIRUBIN_EPS_PEAK / _PEAK_NM / _FWHM_NM` | **OWN.** A Gaussian stand-in — 55,000 M⁻¹cm⁻¹ at 460 nm, 60 nm FWHM — for a spectrum this corpus does not tabulate. |
| `bruise::Params::substrate = 0.55` | **OWN, and deliberately neutral.** A skin tone belongs to a caller; neutral is what makes `a*` and `b*` measure the bruise. |
| `burn::EPIDERMIS_MM = 0.1`, `burn::EPIDERMIS.k = 0.21` | **OWN.** Gowrishankar's Table 1 has both rows, but they are truncated in this corpus' extraction of the paper. Both sit in the range the burn literature uses, and `k` is below the dermis' 0.45, which is the property that matters. |
| `wick::Sheet::default()` — `pore_radius_um = 10`, `contact_angle_deg = 30`, `porosity = 0.7` | **OWN.** No paper here tabulates cotton. The front law is a single straight capillary, so it is an upper bound on a real fabric; the radius is where the tortuosity is hiding. |
| `wick::FRONT_SOFTNESS = 0.15` | **OWN.** A shape parameter for the saturation edge, proportional to the front radius. |
