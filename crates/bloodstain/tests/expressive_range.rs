//! **Expressive range: does the model actually produce different-looking blood?**
//!
//! A generator can be deterministic, physically sourced and fully tested and still produce one
//! pattern at six intensities. That failure is invisible to every other kind of test — each mechanism
//! passes its own unit tests while the *set* of outputs collapses onto a single blob — so it needs a
//! measurement of its own.
//!
//! The method is the one the procedural-generation literature calls an expressive-range analysis:
//! sample the generator across its input space, project each output onto a small number of
//! interpretable metrics, and histogram. Two failure modes then become numbers:
//!
//! - **Collapse** — too few occupied buckets. The generator has fewer distinct outputs than it has
//!   knobs.
//! - **Domination** — one bucket holding most of the samples. The generator has a favourite, and
//!   everything else is a rounding error a player will never see.
