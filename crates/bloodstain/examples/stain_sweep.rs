//! **Stain silhouettes across the impact angle, in ASCII.**

//! Terminal only — no window, no GPU, no asset — so it runs anywhere, including over ssh on a box
//! with no display. What it shows is the one relation the whole of bloodstain-pattern analysis rests
//! on: `minor / major = sin θ`. At 90° the stain is a disc; at 15° it is a lance with its spines
//! thrown downrange.
