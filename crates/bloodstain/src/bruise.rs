//! **A bruise, as the chemistry that makes one.** Haemoglobin leaks, is eaten, becomes bilirubin,
//! and the colour follows from the two concentrations rather than from a ramp between two swatches.
//!
//! # Why a kinetics rather than a colour walk
//!
//! [`crate::dry`] walks blood *outside* the body through a published sequence of oxidation stops.
//! A bruise is the opposite problem: the blood is *inside*, nothing evaporates, and the colours a
//! player recognises — red, then purple, then green-yellow, then gone — are the visible trace of
//! **two chromophores at different concentrations moving at different speeds**. A ramp cannot say
//! that, because the yellow is not a later shade of the red: it is a *different molecule*, produced
//! from the red one, diffusing four times faster, and outliving it. That is why a two-week-old
//! bruise has a yellow *halo wider than* its red core, and why the halo is what dates it.
//!
//! # The model: Stam et al. 2010, reduced to one radial dimension
//!
//! Stam, van Gemert, van Leeuwen & Aalders, *"3D finite compartment modeling of formation and
//! healing of bruises may identify methods for age determination of bruises"*, Med Biol Eng Comput
//! 48 (2010), `doi:10.1007/s11517-010-0647-5`. Their model is a 100 × 100 × 3 compartment grid
//! stepped at Δt = 0.1 h; four mechanisms move or consume the chromophores, and this module keeps
//! all four:
//!
//! 1. **Darcy convection** across the subcutis/dermis border, `v = K·Δp`, carrying whole blood out
//!    of the pool. The ruptured vessels close, so it **stops at 12 h** (their §"Simulations and
//!    parameters", citing their refs 18 and 30).
//! 2. **Fick diffusion** of both chromophores, horizontally *and* vertically — the addition that
//!    made their model spatial, and the reason a front exists to measure.
//! 3. **Michaelis–Menten** conversion of haemoglobin by heme oxygenase-1, `V_max·[HO]·c/(K_m + c)`.
//!    At bruise concentrations `c ≫ K_m`, so it runs saturated and is effectively zero-order until
//!    the pool is nearly exhausted — which is why the red fades at a near-constant rate.
//! 4. **Bilirubin production at 4 mol per mol of haemoglobin** (four hemes to a tetramer), then
//!    lymphatic clearance on a 240 h time constant.
//!
//! The reduction to **one radial dimension** is exact for the circularly symmetric bruise their
//! Fig. 3 discusses, which is the only case a caller can author without supplying a bruise-shaped
//! image. Their 100 × 100 lateral grid becomes [`SHELLS`] annuli over [`RADIUS_MM`], and their three
//! layers stay three: dermis top, dermis bottom, subcutis. Convection is `3 → 2` only; layer 1 is
//! reached by diffusion, exactly as their Eq. 1 specifies ("neglecting the convection from the
//! subcutaneous layer to the top layer of the dermis").
//!
//! # The colour
//!
//! The top 400 µm of dermis is the layer light comes back out of, so it is the layer whose
//! absorption decides the colour. Its `μa(λ)` is the haemoglobin absorption of [`crate::spectral`]
//! — Bosschaart et al. 2014, `doi:10.1007/s10103-013-1446-7`, mixed at venous saturation, because
//! extravasated blood is not being oxygenated — scaled by how much haemoglobin is actually there
//! against the whole-blood 150 g/l the table was measured at, **plus** a bilirubin band. That total
//! goes through the same Kubelka–Munk layer solution [`crate::spectral::kubelka_munk`] uses, over an
//! authored skin substrate, and out through the CIE observer.
//!
//! So an unbruised patch is the substrate, a fresh bruise is the substrate seen through blood, and
//! an old one is the substrate seen through bilirubin. Nothing is authored per age.
//!
//! # What is this crate's own
//!
//! Stam's Table 1 is the source for every kinetic constant but one and for the two dermal
//! thicknesses. Six numbers are **not** in it and say so here rather than hiding in a literal:
//!
//! - [`Params::clearance_h`] — 240 h is Randeberg's figure as Stam quote it in their discussion;
//!   their own Table 1 column is 150 h. Inside the paper's range, but not the paper's column.
//! - [`Params::subcutis_mm`] — their Table 1 gives dermal thicknesses only.
//! - [`DERMIS_MUSP_MM`] — Bosschaart's tables are *blood*, not dermis, so the scattering of the
//!   layer the blood sits in has no source in this crate's corpus.
//! - [`BILIRUBIN_EPS_PEAK`], [`BILIRUBIN_PEAK_NM`], [`BILIRUBIN_FWHM_NM`] — a Gaussian stand-in for
//!   a spectrum that is not tabulated here.
//! - [`Params::substrate`] — a skin tone is authored by a caller, and the default is deliberately
//!   neutral so `a*` and `b*` measure the *bruise*.
//! - [`Params::ho_induction_h`] — Stam fit a relaxation time this corpus cannot read; its own field
//!   carries the whole argument.
//!
//! # Two things this model does not do, because its source does not
//!
//! **A bruise is red the moment it is made, and this one is not.** Stam say why in as many words:
//! "although the dermis also contains small vessels, we assume that the blood comes from the
//! subcutaneous layer, therefore, the contribution of ruptured dermal vessels is neglected". So all
//! the haemoglobin the colour can see has to *arrive* — by Darcy convection and then by diffusion
//! across half a millimetre at `0.01 mm²/h` — and the reddest moment lands a day or two in, not at
//! `t = 0`. A caller who wants day-zero red draws the impact's own blood over the top of this;
//! that is [`crate::stain`]'s job and this module should not be guessing at it.
//!
//! **A fresh bruise is not blue here.** Deep blood reads blue-purple because *scattering* between
//! it and the eye is wavelength-dependent — the reason a vein looks blue — and that is a
//! multi-layer transport effect, not an absorption one. The single Kubelka–Munk layer here cannot
//! produce it, and authoring a blue would be a colour dressed as a computation.
