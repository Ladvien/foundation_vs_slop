//! **Blood soaking into cloth.** A capillary front on a porous sheet, with the shear-thinning
//! viscosity the rest of this crate already knows about.
//!
//! # Why this is not a growing circle
//!
//! Blood spreading on a *surface* is [`crate::pool`]; blood spreading *into* a bandage, a shirt or a
//! mattress is a different physics with a different signature, and the signature is what makes it
//! worth modelling: the stain's radius goes as **√t**, so it races outward at first and visibly
//! stalls — halving its speed every time it doubles its reach — without anything decaying, timing
//! out or being clamped. A circle grown at a constant rate looks like a shader; a √t front looks
//! like cloth.
//!
//! # Lucas–Washburn, and what a shear-thinning fluid does to it
//!
//! The classical law, in the form Steinik, Picchi, Lavalle & Poesio quote it — *"Inertial and
//! shear-thinning effects in the capillary rise of a non-Newtonian fluid"*, Phys. Rev. Fluids 9,
//! 023305 (2024), `doi:10.1103/physrevfluids.9.023305`, their Eq. 1:
//!
//! ```text
//! L² = γ r cos(θ) t / (2 μ)
//! ```
//!
//! Blood is not Newtonian, so `μ` is not a number: [`crate::rheo`] makes it a function of shear
//! rate, and the shear rate at the front falls as the front slows. Steinik et al.'s result is that
//! this **does not** leave the ½ exponent alone. Their conclusion, in their words: "we generalize
//! the Lucas-Washburn scaling relation to shear-thinning fluids showing that the classical 1/2
//! scaling law holds only if an ad hoc time-dependent effective viscosity is introduced". Their
//! rescaling — time divided by the dimensionless wall viscosity — collapses every shear-thinning
//! curve back onto the ½ law, and [`Sheet::rescaled_time_s`] is that variable.
//!
//! So this module reports both, and the tests assert both: the **raw** front is monotone and rises
//! *more slowly* than √t (log-log slope ≈ 0.46 over 1–100 s, which is the shear-thinning
//! fingerprint), and the **rescaled** front is √t to within 2 %.
//!
//! Steinik et al. use the Ellis model, which has a closed-form velocity profile in a tube; this
//! crate has Carreau–Yasuda with Cho & Kensey's constants fitted to whole blood, and a second
//! constitutive model for one module would be a second answer to the question [`crate::rheo`]
//! already answers. The wall shear rate is the Newtonian tube relation `γ̇ = 4v̄/r`, evaluated at
//! the front's own speed.
//!
//! # One fixed-point pass, and exactly what it costs
//!
//! `μ_eff` depends on the front's speed, which depends on `μ_eff`. That is a fixed point, and the
//! iteration count would be a **hidden dial** on a frozen model — this crate's rule everywhere else
//! is a fixed schedule with no convergence test, so the count here is **one**: the zero-shear
//! plateau gives a first front, its speed gives a wall shear rate, and the viscosity there gives the
//! answer.
//!
//! **What one pass leaves on the table is measured rather than assumed.** At the shipped cotton a
//! second pass lengthens the front by 3.8 % at 1 s and 11.9 % at 100 s, and a third adds under a
//! tenth of that again — the iteration contracts hard, so one pass is a *truncation with a known
//! sign* (it under-predicts) rather than an unstable guess. It also captures the effect that
//! matters: the first pass already moves `μ` from the 0.056 Pa·s zero-shear plateau to about
//! 0.004 Pa·s, an order of magnitude, and every later pass is trimming a few per cent off a number
//! that has already stopped being the Newtonian one.
//! [`tests::the_fixed_point_iteration_contracts`] pins both halves of that.
//!
//! # What is this crate's own
//!
//! [`Sheet::surface_tension_n_m`] defaults to [`crate::droplet::BLOOD_SURFACE_TENSION`], which is
//! measured. The three sheet parameters are **authored**: no paper in this crate's corpus tabulates
//! the pore radius, contact angle or porosity of cotton. Each says so on its own field.
//!
//! One structural caveat, because it decides how the output should be read: Lucas–Washburn is a
//! **single straight capillary**, and a woven sheet's channels are neither single nor straight. Real
//! tortuosity retards the front, so this is an **upper bound** on how fast a fabric wicks, and a
//! caller matching a photograph tightens [`Sheet::pore_radius_um`] rather than scaling the answer
//! afterwards — the radius is the parameter the geometry is actually hiding in.
