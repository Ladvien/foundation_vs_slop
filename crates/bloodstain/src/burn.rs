//! **A burn, as the heat that made it.** One-dimensional layered bioheat conduction, and an
//! Arrhenius damage integral per node.
//!
//! # Why a heat equation rather than a depth
//!
//! A burn is the one injury in this crate whose severity is **not** a function of geometry. Nothing
//! is cut, nothing is displaced; what varies is how long tissue spent above a temperature, and the
//! depth of the injury is the *output* of that history rather than an input to it. So a "third-degree
//! burn" cannot be authored as a depth without discarding the only thing that decides it: a 200 °C
//! contact for 200 ms and a 55 °C contact for a minute are different injuries, and only a rate
//! process distinguishes them.
//!
//! That also makes the interesting behaviour free. **Damage keeps accruing after the heat is gone**,
//! because the tissue is still hot — which is why a burn worsens for a while after contact ends, and
//! why cooling it early matters. Here that is not a rule; it is what happens when [`Burn::expose`] is
//! called a second time at a lower temperature.
//!
//! # The model: Pennes conduction, Gowrishankar's layers, Henriques' rate process
//!
//! Gowrishankar, Stewart, Martin & Weaver, *"Transport lattice models of heat transport in skin with
//! spatially heterogeneous, temperature-dependent perfusion"*, BioMedical Engineering OnLine 3:42
//! (2004), `doi:10.1186/1475-925x-3-42`. Their three-layer skin — non-perfused viable epidermis over
//! perfused dermis and subcutis — its thermal properties, its surface-contact boundary condition
//! (33 °C at rest, stepped to the contact temperature at `t = 0`, core held at 37 °C), and its damage
//! estimate are what this module is:
//!
//! ```text
//! ρc ∂T/∂t = ∂/∂z(k ∂T/∂z) + ρ_b c_b ω (T_a − T)          (Pennes)
//! dΩ/dt    = A exp(−ΔE / ℜT),  integrated only where T ≥ 42 °C
//! ```
//!
//! with `A` = [`ARRHENIUS_A`], `ΔE` = [`ACTIVATION_J_MOL`] and `ℜ` = [`GAS_CONSTANT`], all three
//! quoted from their Eq. 7, and the 42 °C onset from the same place (their refs 57, 58). They state
//! the reading of the indicator this module's [`Degree`] rests on: "complete epidermal necrosis
//! corresponds to Ω = 1".
//!
//! # The thresholds are not in this crate's corpus, and that is said rather than hidden
//!
//! [`OMEGA_FIRST`] `= 0.53` and [`OMEGA_THIRD`] `= 1e4` are the classical burn-degree thresholds
//! attributed to Henriques' rate-process analysis. **Neither value appears in any paper in this
//! crate's local corpus** — searched: this paper, `doi:10.2174/1874120701105010047` and
//! `doi:10.3390/ma18153524`, both thermal-damage reviews. Only `Ω = 1` is sourced, above. So the
//! other two are cited by reference to Moritz & Henriques, *"Studies of thermal injury II: the
//! relative importance of time and surface temperature in the causation of cutaneous burns"*, Am J
//! Pathol 26 (1947) 695–720 — which is Gowrishankar's own reference 55 — and **flagged: threshold
//! values not in corpus**.
//!
//! One consequence is worth stating because it will look like a bug otherwise. `A` and `ΔE` come
//! from Weaver's and Lee's kinetics; the thresholds come from Henriques'. They are **different rate
//! processes**, so the thresholds land early against these constants: at exactly the 42 °C onset,
//! `A exp(−ΔE/ℜT)` is `4.5e-3 s⁻¹`, so `Ω = 1` accrues in about 222 s of contact. Clinically 42 °C
//! is tolerated far longer than that. The mismatch is in the literature, not in this code, and the
//! honest thing is to name it rather than to quietly retune someone's published constant.
