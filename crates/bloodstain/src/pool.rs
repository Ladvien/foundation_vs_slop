//! # Deterministic, because pool placement is simulation-visible
//!
//! A consuming game reads pool positions as a chemoattractant, so two runs that kill the same body
//! must pool in the same places, bit for bit. Drawing them is the cosmetic half and belongs to the
//! consumer.

//!
//! Pools form on the **single horizontal plane** the spatter model already solves against
//! ([`crate::droplet::landing`]). Flowing downhill to the lowest reachable point needs a heightfield
//! this crate does not have, and growing one here would be a second world model.
