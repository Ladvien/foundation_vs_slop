//! **The forensic pattern taxonomy, as generators.** Six classes, each a different mechanism.
//!
//! # Why six generators and not one cone with six presets
//!
//! The SWGSTAIN / ASB TR-033 taxonomy is a *classification* of mechanisms: an analyst reads a scene
//! backwards from stain morphology to what produced it, and the classes exist because they are
//! distinguishable. A game that throws one isotropic cone for every event has exactly one pattern at
//! six intensities, and a player reads it as one thing happening repeatedly.
//!
//! So each generator here is a different mechanism, and the differences are the measured ones:
//!
//! - [`impact_spatter`] — the percolation cone. Many droplets, size inversely correlated with speed.
//! - [`arterial_arc`] — **one arc of large discrete droplets per systole**, not another cone, with a
//!   reach that decays as the body loses pressure.
//! - [`cast_off`] — released **tangentially** to a swinging tip's path, with diameter *inversely*
//!   proportional to tangential speed, from a pendant volume that is capped.
//! - [`expirated`] — a fine mist, sometimes with bubble rings, usually without.
//! - [`drip_trail`] — spacing that encodes walking speed, from a budget that runs out.
//! - [`transfer`] — a contact smear that moves blood out of that same budget.
//!
//! # The budget is what makes a pattern tell a story
//!
//! [`cast_off`], [`drip_trail`] and [`transfer`] all take `load_ml: &mut f32` and **decrement it**. A
//! dragged body runs out of blood; a knife swung six times sheds less each swing. That conservation is
//! the difference between a pattern that reads as evidence and one that reads as a particle emitter
//! with a lifetime.
