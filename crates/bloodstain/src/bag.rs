//! **Variety selection that cannot repeat early, and cannot be perturbed by iteration order.**
//!
//! # The arithmetic this module exists to fix
//!
//! Picking a variant with `seed % n` is a fresh uniform draw every time, so it has a birthday
//! problem. With four variants the probability that four consecutive stains contain a repeat is
//!
//! > `1 − 4! / 4⁴ = 1 − 24/256 = 90.6 %`
//!
//! so the *expected* first visible repeat is the fourth stain. A floor of blood reads as tiled almost
//! immediately, and authoring more textures moves the number without fixing the shape of the problem.
//!
//! # Why not a shuffle bag with a cursor
//!
//! The usual fix is a bag you draw from and refill, which is a **mutable cursor**. Two problems, both
//! recorded failures in this family of crates: a cursor advanced from inside an ECS system is advanced
//! in query order, which is not stable across `App` instances; and a cursor is state a replay has to
//! carry and restore, so a single missed increment desynchronises everything after it permanently.
//!
//! So this bag has no state. It is a **pure function of a draw ordinal**, which means a replay
//! reproduces it by construction and nothing about the order things were visited can reach it.

/// blocks is a rotation by one (no repeat across it either). Written out, the index dealt at ordinal

/// the slot within the block falls by one as the block rises by one. So **the minimum gap between
/// repeats is `n − 1`**, exactly, for every `n` and every site.
