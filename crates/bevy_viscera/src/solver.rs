//! **The XPBD step: a fixed number of substeps, a fixed number of iterations, a fixed sequence.**
//!
//! Extended position-based dynamics (Macklin, Müller & Chentanez, *XPBD: position-based simulation of
//! compliant constrained dynamics*, MIG 2016) replaces PBD's iteration-count-dependent stiffness with a
//! physical **compliance** `α`, entering the projection as `α̃ = α / Δt²`:
//!
//! ```text
//! Δλ  = (−C − α̃ λ) / (Σ wᵢ |∇ᵢC|² + α̃)

//! ```
//!
//! Deul, Charrier & Bender (*Direct position-based solver for stiff rods*, CGF 37(6),
//! `doi:10.1111/cgf.13326`) is the rod formulation this follows — their zero-stretch/bend-twist
//! decomposition is what the two compliances here stand in for. The bending term is a *position-only*
//! surrogate: Bergou et al. (*Discrete elastic rods*, ACM TOG 27(3), `doi:10.1145/1399504.1360662`)
//! write bending against the curvature binormal of a material frame, and a frame is state this crate
//! deliberately does not carry, so the resistance to turning is expressed instead as a distance
//! constraint across the triple `(i−1, i+1)` at twice the rest length. It resists coiling and never
//! resists straightening — a chain of rest-length segments cannot exceed that span.
//!
//! **Nothing here reads a clock and nothing here converges early.** The tick length is
//! [`FIXED_DT`], the counts come from [`crate::ViscSettings`], and each iteration walks the whole
//! sequence whether or not the residual is already zero. Constraints that are *skipped* — torn,
//! degenerate, or slack — are skipped by data, not by convergence, so the pass count is the same for
//! every strand on every run.
