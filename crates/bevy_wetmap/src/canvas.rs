    ///
    /// 1. **Drip.** A wet texel holding more than `drip_rate` sheds the *excess* one texel along
    ///    `gravity_uv` and keeps the rest. What leaves one texel arrives in exactly one other, or is
    ///    lost at the border — nothing else, because the step is a translation, so at most one texel
    ///    can ever step into another. **Conserved exactly wherever the destination is also wet:** a
    ///    wet destination sheds down to the threshold, so its residue is at most `threshold` and the
    ///    parcel is at most `255 − threshold`, which sums to exactly 255. The one lossy case is blood
    ///    running onto a *dry crust that is already saturated*, and there the loss is the model rather
    ///    than a rounding error: `amount` is normalised coverage, a texel at 255 is fully covered, and
    ///    more blood on it is not representable because it is not visible.
    /// 2. **Spread.** `spread_rate` diffuses into the 4-neighbourhood, written as an antisymmetric flux
    ///    on each edge's coverage difference: `round(spread_rate/4 · (aᵢ − aⱼ))`. `f32::round` is odd,
    ///    so the flux one way is exactly minus the flux the other, and mass is conserved to the byte.
    /// 3. **Time.** `age` increments and the substrate takes its cut — see
    ///    [`WetSettings::absorbency`]. Age stops at `dry_ticks`, which makes a fully dried canvas a
    ///    **fixed point** of this function: nothing moves, no byte changes, and no upload is asked for.
    /// 4. **Shade.** `bloodstain::dry::appearance` writes the sRGB and roughness bytes.
    ///
    /// **Dry paint does not move.** Wetness gates every change to `amount` in passes 1–3, which is
    /// what makes a run stop where it stopped rather than creeping forever, and what stops a dried
    /// crust from soaking away.
    ///
